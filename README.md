# Breast Cancer Prediction
---

## Background :
Breast cancer occurs in women (and rarely in men). It is cancer that forms in the cells of breasts. The cells in the breasts grow out of control. Its symptoms include :
> A lump breast;
> Changing in the size, shape, or appearance of the breast;
> Irritation or dimpling of breast skin;
> Pulling in of the nipple or pain in the nipple area;
> Etc.

<ins>Note</ins> : Lumps or changes in the breast are not all cancerous, but it is always best to have any unusual symptoms checked by a doctor.

## Context : 

This project is an essay assigned to the second promotion of Data Dev students (N'Djamena). As a Data Developers (Data Scientists) we will :
> * Analyze and Visualize data;
> * Normalize data 
> * Create a model to classify wether a person is with breast cancer or not.

Link to dataset : The dataset used in this project was dowloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/merishnasuwal/breast-cancer-prediction-dataset) ([dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/merishnasuwal/breast-cancer-prediction-dataset/download?datasetVersionNumber=2)).
